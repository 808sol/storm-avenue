# EmailJS Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Environment Variables on Vercel

**Issue**: Form works locally but not on Vercel.

**Solution**:
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add these variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
4. **Important**: After adding variables, you must **redeploy** your project

### 2. EmailJS Template Configuration

**Issue**: Emails not being sent or received.

**Solution**:
1. Log into your EmailJS dashboard
2. Go to Email Templates
3. Ensure your template has these variables:
   ```
   {{from_name}}
   {{from_email}}
   {{phone}}
   {{service}}
   {{message}}
   {{to_email}}
   {{reply_to}}
   ```
4. Set "To email" field in template to: `{{to_email}}`
5. Set "Reply to" field to: `{{reply_to}}`

### 3. Email Service Configuration

**Issue**: Service not properly configured.

**Solution**:
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to Email Services
2. Verify your email service is connected (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Check daily email limit hasn't been exceeded
4. Ensure service status is "Active"

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Local Testing
```bash
# Check if environment variables are loaded
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-emailjs
```
